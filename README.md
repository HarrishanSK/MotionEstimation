# Motion Estimation, Predicting the next frame of a video and Counting the number of moving vehicles in a video

This is a computer vision project to fulfill the requirements which can be found in the report. For this project i wrote 22 MatLab functions from scratch. 
My code can be found in the './code' directory along with a 'README.txt' file which explains how to run each cell in MatLab.
